During quarantine due to COVID-19, I went back to my homeland. Also all of the lab stuff stand still for a period of time and it is inevitable that to have a lot amount of time.

I wanted to spend these days of quarantine more useful so I began to take DataCamp courses.

 I began with the Data Science with Python track; eventhough I knew many of the included content, it did not take long for me to figure out that I need to learn more and more.

For now, I just share the projects that I did during my Career Track Journey. Iâ€™ve not completed any career track as today (11.04.2020) but I will keep going on this and many other courses available.

Please feel free to give feedbacks, recommendations; ask anything you want and etc.
